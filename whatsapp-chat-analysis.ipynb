Modern multicore processors scale to over one hundred cores, have wide vector units, maintain a complex memory hierarchy and even share the memory with accelerators such as GPU. Conventional programming models using threads impose significant complexity to organize code into multiple threads of control and balance work amongst threads to ensure proper utilization of computing resources. This shortcoming has helped the advent of high-productivity parallel programming models that require minimal changes to the sequential program and can still deliver high performance using runtimes-based approaches on various architectures. This talk will first introduce one task-based programming model implementation that offers high productivity and performance and will conclude with an overview of research opportunities in this area.\\n\\n\\nBio:\\n\\nVivek Kumar is an Assistant Professor at IIIT-Delhi. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Australian National University in 2014. His Ph.D. research focused on using managed runtime techniques to improve parallel programming performance and productivity on multicore architectures. Before joining Ph.D. program, he worked for nearly six years in research and development positions in the High-Performance Computing area at technology firms based in Bangalore. After Ph.D., he worked for almost three years as a Research Scientist at Rice University in the Habanero Extreme Scale Software Research Group.
